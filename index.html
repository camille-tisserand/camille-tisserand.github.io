<h2>My childhood</h2>
</center> 
<body>
    <p>I was born in Paris, in January. I spent almost all my childhood in Paris and Great Paris. My father was working on a company and my mother was giving some english course to primary students. Paris was not fun for holliday so, for each holiday we had we were going to my grand mothers' house in Hossegor or in Perigueux. After almost 10 years in Paris my parents were fedup of the capital and wanted to move to an other city. the most part of our family was around Bordeaux and also, Bordeaux was closer to Perigueux and to Hossegor. 
        So, in 2010 the Tisserand family packed everything to leave Paris for Bordeaux.</p>

<h2>The moving out</h2>
</center>
<body>
    <p> I will not lie by saying that I was happy to leave Paris. I wasn't, i was leave my friends of always, the town where I had memories. But my parents needed to leave. Our new house in Bordeaux was very weird so, we had a lot of work to do inside and we decided to do it at the same time we were living inside. Our first year in Bordeaux was a nightmare. The house in which we lived was being renovated, my father was still working in Paris, the adaptation in this small community was not easy. 
        Indeed, we had moved a little hastily in my opinion. These early years were not easy. The work was on everyone's nerves and the fact that my father was leaving for weeks at a time was not easy to live with either.</p>
